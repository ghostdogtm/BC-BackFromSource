BC - Back From Source
=====================
Build
----------- 
To compile, run !Make.bat 

The code assembles with ASM6 (v1.3) - a 6502 assembler by loopy (loopy at mm.st). 

Changed places in code mostly marked with ';!' sign 

Thanks
----------- 
I'm grateful to Crash Nicker and 2DDarkKnight for great levels designed. Also thanks to emu-land team and Max Silver for additional game testing.
